7th October 2021:

1. Searched Google "free header images"

2. I downloaded the images from Pixabay (bigger size only)
(https://pixabay.com/illustrations/wire-frame-head-technology-human-1311161/)

3.Then, resized using Photo app to 500px height. In this process, kept the aspect ratio same.

4. Then in the slider (carousel), fixed the height also to 500px.
